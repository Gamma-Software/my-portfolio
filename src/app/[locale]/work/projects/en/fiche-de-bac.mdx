## Overview

This project is THE very first Android application I created. I discovered Eclipse (at the time Android Studio didn't exist) and I discovered Android development.
The goal was to create an application that compiled all my physics-chemistry baccalaureate study notes (I got 17/20 on the physics-chemistry baccalaureate exam).

## Main Features

- Baccalaureate study notes
- Course notes
- Lab work notes
- Summary notes
- Test if you would pass the baccalaureate

## Technologies Used

- Eclipse
- Android
- Java for development

## Challenges and Learnings

- Discovering development in general
- Discovering Android development
- Discovering Eclipse
- Discovering SQLite

## Results

I was fortunate to be contacted by someone from [Clairefontaine](https://www.clairefontaine.com/fr/) and got sponsored to earn money.

Here's a presentation video of the application:
