## Overview

AppifyAI - Your personal assistant for web application development.
I developed this application with the goal of creating web applications through a simple chat with an AI assistant in seconds.
All you need to do is have a conversation with it, give it instructions, or ask questions about the application.

It will teach you throughout the process how to develop the application, but most importantly, it will apply the instructions and you can see the results instantly!

## How does it work?

AppifyAI is a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) application that generates Streamlit web applications in seconds.
The power of the tool lies in its ability to display the application in real-time as it's being generated.

## Main Features

- Python code generation
- Discussion with AI assistant
- Automatic error correction

## Technologies Used

AppifyAI leverages the power of [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s LLMs, [ðŸ¦œðŸ”— LangChain](https://langchain.com/), [ChromaDB](https://chroma.db/), and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

## Challenges and Learnings

This application allowed me to discover LLMs and understand how to use them for code generation.
I implemented an authentication system, which took a lot of time to set up because Streamlit isn't really designed for this purpose.
