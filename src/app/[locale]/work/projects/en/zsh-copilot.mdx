## Overview

A lightweight Zsh plugin that predict your next command using llm. You can also ask to create a command.
The project is available on [https://github.com/Gamma-Software/zsh-copilot](https://github.com/Gamma-Software/zsh-copilot).

## For who ?

zsh-copilot is for everyone who use zsh shell.

## What it solves

Using the command line can be challenging, especially when:

- You need to remember **complex command syntax** and options
- You want to **automate repetitive tasks** but don't know the right commands
- You encounter **errors** and need help fixing them
- You want to **be more productive** but spend time looking up commands

zsh-copilot helps solve these problems by:

- **Predicting** your next command based on your history and patterns
- **Generating** commands from natural language descriptions
- **Fixing** command errors automatically
- **Streamlining** your command-line workflow with AI assistance

## How it works

It uses ChatGPT to generate, fix or predict your shell commands.

## Features

### Generate command

zsh-copilot can generate command based on your history and patterns. For instance you run the following command:

```zsh
zca search for the file "test.txt" in the current directory
```

The `zca` command is alias of `zsh-copilot ask`.

You can also write the command then call a shortcut you set in the environment variable via `zsh-copilot config`. By default it's `ctrl+k then ctrl+a`.

### Fix command

zsh-copilot can fix your command error. After getting an error in your shell terminal, you can ask to fix it.

```zsh
ls )l
zsh: parse error near `)'
```

To fix it, you can ask to fix it.

```zsh
zca fix
```

You can also call a shortcut you set in the environment variable via `zsh-copilot config`. By default it's `ctrl+k then ctrl+f`.

### Predict command

zsh-copilot can predict your next command. Call the shortcut you set in the environment variable via `zsh-copilot config`. By default it's `ctrl+k then ctrl+p`.

## Technologies

- **Zsh**: The shell used by zsh-copilot.
- **ChatGPT**: The llm used by zsh-copilot.

## Challenges and learnings

It's the first time I create a zsh plugin. I learn a lot about zsh and zsh plugin development.

## Results

Not knowing every command syntax and options is a common problem. zsh-copilot helps you to be more productive by predicting your next command, fixing your command error and generating command.
It's a great tool to help you to be more productive.
