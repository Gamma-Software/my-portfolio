## Overview

This is a tool to help you perform your qualitative data analysis.
🧐 For example, it can take your transcriptions and generate codes and themes for you 💡.
It summarizes your data and can help you gain insights from your data. 📊

### Background

For my wife's thesis, she needed a tool to help her perform qualitative data analysis on the transcriptions she had made.
📚 LLMs are really good at understanding human semantics and thus performing qualitative data analysis.
🧠 This application helped her achieve an almost instant result, and I'm sure it can help you too. 👍

The application and the LLM prompt are greatly inspired by the video by [Dr Philip Adu, Ph.D](https://www.drphilipadu.com/)
titled [Master Qualitative Data Analysis with ChatGPT: An 18-Minute Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1WelrcgLGM).

## Main Features

- Upload your transcriptions 📂
- Generate a summary on all data or specific data 📊
- Based on a research question, generate a data summary, generate codes and themes. ❓
- Update qualitative data analysis parameters 🔄
- Generate a qualitative data analysis report and download it 📄

### Limitations

Currently, the tool cannot perform qualitative data analysis on large datasets because the LLM used is limited to 16000 tokens. 🚫
Data is not cached, nor is the report. So, if you refresh the page, the data will need to be uploaded again and the report regenerated. 🔄

### Improvements

- Upload voice transcriptions, convert them to text, and perform qualitative data analysis 🗣️
- Connect to qualitative data analysis software 🤝
- (double-check) Perform intermediate checks on results to avoid LLM biases 🤔
- Perform a map-refine summary on the data
- Handle large data transcriptions

## Technologies Used

Qualitative data analysis uses LLMs or Large Language Models to generate summaries/codes/themes and classify them.
 🤖 The application is developed with Python.

### Python Library

This tool is powered by libraries:

- Streamlit: For the user interface 🖥️
- Langchain: For creating LLM applications 🔗
- OpenAI: The LLM provider. For now, we have only integrated this LLM.

## Challenges and Learnings

I discovered with this project that LLMs are really good at performing qualitative data analysis.
They are capable of generating codes and themes based on a research question.
It's a very simple tool to use and can be very useful for performing qualitative data analysis of transcriptions.
I learned to use Streamlit and Langchain, and I discovered new ways to use LLMs.
