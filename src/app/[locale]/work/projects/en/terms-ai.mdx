## Overview

This is a tool to help you analyze and extract terms from a contract.
üßê It processes one or more contracts; you ask questions, and it generates a table with the answer to each question for each contract üí°.
You can also generate a summary of each contract.

## Background

The idea came to me when I started reading software terms of use.
I found it very tedious. No one wants to read all the terms of use of Facebook, for example.
So, I thought it might be interesting to have a tool that extracts information from these contracts.
And highlights the important information that a person might need.
Then I thought we could do it for insurance, credit, lease contracts, etc.

## Examples of applications

I think this tool is very useful for helping people who need to extract data from similar files. For example, we can think of:

- Lawyers who need to conduct legal monitoring
- HR professionals who need to generate a summary table of candidates' skills
- Companies that need to generate a summary table of service costs
- Users who want to retrieve information from a software's terms of use

## Key Features

- Read a contract even if it's an image file because the tool will generate a PDF using [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) üìÑ
- Generate a summary of each contract üìÑ
- Ask questions about each contract üí¨
- Generate a table with the answer to each question for each contract üìä
- Update the contract's metadata with the report

### Limitations

For demonstration purposes, the application is limited to 3 PDFs and a maximum of 5 questions.
PDFs cannot exceed 4 pages.

### How it Works

The features are fully customizable. You can choose to activate one or more.

- Upload a contract (or multiple)
  - PDF format (text or scanned)
- Select the features to activate
  - Question answering: Ask any questions you have about the contract
  - Summary: Get a summary of the contract
  - Include metadata: Include the results in the contract's metadata
  - Generate a report: Generate a report of the results
- Ask any questions you have about the contract
  - You can ask one question
  - You can ask multiple questions
  - You can ask questions in different languages
  - Or you can skip this step
- Wait for the application to
  - Process the contract
  - Answer your questions
  - Provide you with a summary of the contract
- You can now download the contract with the included metadata of questions and answers, as well as the summary and report

## Technologies Used

Qualitative data analysis uses LLMs or Large Language Models to generate summaries and extract relevant information.
 ü§ñ The application is developed with Python.

### Python Libraries

This tool is powered by libraries:

- Streamlit: For the user interface üñ•Ô∏è
- Langchain: To create LLM applications üîó
- OpenAI: The LLM provider. For now, we have only integrated this LLM.

## Challenges and Learnings

It was the first time I integrated an OCR solution to read image files and then generate a PDF.
It was also the first time I handled PDF files.
And it was the first time I developed a chain of LLM agents. There are 3 agents working in parallel.
Getting them to work together and fine-tuning the prompt was a challenge.

## Results

The application is now capable of reading image files, generating a PDF,
performing OCR, generating a summary, answering questions, and generating a report.
