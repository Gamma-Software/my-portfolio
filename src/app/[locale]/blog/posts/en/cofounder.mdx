**I'm looking for a cofounder to partner with me on my startups. My strength resides in building technological products and I'm looking for the best cofounder that can handle marketing and sales and will be able to help me build a profitable business.
The product I'm working on this [Note Taking App](/work/note-buddy) leveraging AI to be more productive at writing.**

## Background

I always was fascinated by personalities like Steve Jobs, Sir Richard Branson, Leonardo Da Vinci who were able to make things happen.

As you can see on my [work page](/work), I made a lot of projects mainly in the Robotic and Embedded systems field. I started programming when I was 17 years old thanks to a friend back then who knew how to code. I was fascinated by the idea of creating something out of nothing.

Since I'm a little kid I'm obsessed with the idea to create a product that can help people. I started my first business when I started programming and I was able to make money with Android apps in 2011. Especially with a game called "MineTower" which was a Tower Defense game in the Minecraft universe.

I passed my high school diploma and I started my engineering degree. Even in my first job as a software engineer I was able to make a lot of (intra-prenarial) projects.

I recently learned to develop Websites and Web Applications. I'm now working on my first SaaS product called [Note Buddy](/work/note-buddy).
