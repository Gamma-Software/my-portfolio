## Introduction: My Agile Journey and the "Death" of an Ideal

My first encounter with agility was filled with a certain optimism,
a promise of revolution in the way software is conceived and developed.
At the time, the Agile Manifesto, with its core values and twelve principles, resonated
as self-evident (source: [Agile Manifesto for Software Development](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/manifesto)).
The emphasis on individuals and interactions over processes and tools,
on delivering working software over comprehensive documentation,
on customer collaboration over contract negotiation,
and on responding to change over following a rigid plan, seemed to herald a new era,
more human and more efficient.

However, over the years, I have witnessed a growing divergence between this initial ideal and the reality
of implementing agility in many contexts. The optimism of the early days has given way to disillusionment
with the practices that have become widespread under the "Agile" label.
The purpose of this article is to present my experience and argue that, in its current and widespread form,
agility is no longer a viable or truly beneficial approach in many cases.
Together, we will explore the reasons for this disillusionment, drawing on personal observations
and on the trends, criticisms, and evolution of agility as they emerge from recent research.

## 2. The Agile Promise vs. Current Reality: A Personal Reflection

I had the opportunity to work for [Navya](https://navya.tech), a company specializing in autonomous vehicles,
where agility was being implemented when I arrived.
I viewed the establishment of agile ceremonies and principles within the teams favorably,
particularly the creation of the "Driving" agile team.
The idea of properly visualizing projects, breaking them down into tasks, emphasizing
collaboration above all else, and working iteratively was promising,
and principles such as Kanban and the various ceremonies seemed relevant.

However, despite these good intentions, I quickly felt a lack of efficiency.
The constant pursuit of velocity, which is a central goal of agility, sometimes seemed artificial to me.
During sprint retrospectives, we systematically tried to analyze what went well and what went badly,
but there wasn't always material to comment on.
The emphasis on velocity and complexity points, initially conceived as planning tools
and for continuous improvement, transformed into constant pressure to produce more, often at the expense
of quality and the real value delivered to the customer.
As a developer at the time, I was often frustrated by the lack of velocity, paradoxically caused by the significant number of ceremonies.
The daily stand-up meetings, for example, took half an hour each day. Despite efforts to make them quick,
there were always participants who did not respect the format, which slowed down the entire team.

<img src="/images/blog/agile-is-dead/velocity.jpg" alt="velocity" />

I found that the effectiveness of agility depended heavily on the commitment of all members, which was not always the case.
The larger ceremonies, such as Program Increments (PIs), seemed particularly ineffective to me.
Spending an entire day regrouping to discuss upcoming topics did not produce the expected results.
I often thought that a project manager centralizing information and going directly to the relevant stakeholders would be much more effective.
My experience at Navya, where I implemented projects in a V-cycle, confirmed this intuition, as this approach allowed for rapid iteration and better project control.

Another important point is that not everyone is necessarily up-to-date on agility. I had the impression that this term had become a simple "buzzword."
Moreover, we hear less about it today.

Currently at [Worldline](https://worldline.com), I also observe an attempt to apply agility within the teams, but it seems to be losing momentum.
We try to do agility for the sake of it, in the name of efficiency, but the results are not always there.
I have the impression that it takes longer than expected and that the old processes were just as valid.
Ultimately, each company implements an "agility its own way," which does not correspond to the theoretical definition and contributes to its gradual decline.

I also noticed that the adoption of agility was often initiated by a single person within the company.
At Worldline, one person had launched this initiative. However, despite this initial momentum, agility does not always last.

The search for rapid productivity gains, the excessive focus on superficial metrics, and
the challenges related to scaling agility in complex environments have often led
to a superficial and ineffective application of agile methods.

## 3. Deconstructing the Disillusionment: Main Flaws and Criticisms of Modern Agility

Several major flaws and criticisms of modern agility contribute to this widespread disillusionment.
One of the first points concerns the lack of predictability and long-term planning. (source: [Agile Methodology: Advantages and Disadvantages - College of Continuing and Professional Studies](https://ccaps.umn.edu/story/agile-methodology-advantages-and-disadvantages))

While flexibility is an asset, it can make it difficult to establish precise plans and provide
reliable estimates, which is often problematic for stakeholders and for budget management.
Another frequently observed disadvantage is the tendency to underestimate the importance of documentation.

The emphasis on working software over comprehensive documentation can lead to problems
with maintenance, knowledge transfer, and the integration of new team members in the long term.
Because yes, developers are very often very motivated by code, but not by ceremonies and processes.

<img src="/images/blog/agile-is-dead/agile-families-user-story.webp" alt="agile families user story" />

The concept of welcoming changes, even late in development, can easily degenerate into
scope creep and uncontrolled expansion of the project scope. (source: [3 Disadvantages of Agile Methodology | Lucidchart Blog](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/3-disadvantages-of-agile-methodology))

Without rigorous change management, agile projects can get bogged down and never reach their initial completion.

A recurring criticism is the observation that many organizations place
excessive importance on processes and tools, such as Scrum and SAFe frameworks,
and project management platforms like Jira, at the expense of individual autonomy
and genuine collaboration. (source: [is Agile Dead? Examining the Decline in Market Demand and Popularity](https://www.programstrategyhq.com/post/is-agile-dead))

Agility, initially centered on people, risks transforming into a rigid bureaucracy.

The pressure for frequent deliveries and constant adaptation
can also lead to professional burnout and an increase in the demands placed on developers. (source: [Best of 2022: Agile/Scrum is a Failure - Here's Why - DevOps.com](https://devops.com/agile-scrum-is-a-failure-heres-why/))

The sustained pace and the lack of time for reflection and continuous improvement can harm the quality of work and the well-being of teams.
A long-term vision of the system architecture and careful design are essential for the robustness and
maintainability of the software, but they can be neglected in a context of rapid and frequent deliveries.

Finally, the phenomenon of "theatrical agility" is a frequent criticism (source: [20 Common Challenges When Introducing Agile (And How To Overcome Them) - Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2023/12/06/20-common-challenges-when-introducing-agile-and-how-to-overcome-them/)).
This refers to situations where organizations superficially adopt agile practices without understanding or integrating the underlying values and principles.
This staging of agility does not produce the expected benefits and can even generate cynicism and frustration within the teams.

## 4. Evidence of Decline: Trends in Agile Adoption and Satisfaction

The analysis of reports on the state of agility reveals illuminating trends regarding
the adoption and satisfaction of this approach.
While the adoption of agility remains high in many sectors, satisfaction rates,
particularly in medium and large organizations, have shown a downward trend (source: [5 Key Takeaways from The 17th State of Agile Report - Praecipio](https://www.praecipio.com/resources/articles/state-of-agile-report-special-edition)).

The 17th State of Agile Report indicates that while a majority of organizations use agility in their
software development lifecycle, only a small proportion declare themselves very satisfied. (source: [17th State of Agile Report | Press Releases | Digital.ai](https://digital.ai/press-releases/17th-state-of-agile-report-71-use-agile-in-their-sdlc-small-organizations-report-strong-business-benefits-medium-and-larger-sized-companies-continue-to-experience-barriers-in-successfully-scaling-a/))

The reasons cited for this dissatisfaction are multiple, including organizational resistance to change,
lack of understanding of agility by management, and a disconnect between agile practitioners
and business objectives. The report highlights that small agile organizations are more
satisfied than large ones, suggesting that the challenges related to scaling agility are a significant factor in dissatisfaction.
From my experience, as Navya grew, agility lost its meaning and interest.

<img src="/images/blog/agile-is-dead/talk-agile.jpeg" alt="talk agile" />

Furthermore, there is a growing number of articles and discussions suggesting increasing disillusionment
with agility and a search for "post-agile" approaches. (source: [Is Agile Dead? Examining the Decline in Market Demand and Popularity](https://www.programstrategyhq.com/post/is-agile-dead))

This emergence of new perspectives reflects a need to move beyond the perceived limitations and rigidities of traditional agile frameworks.

- Disconnect between agile practitioners and business objectives (source: [17th State of Agile Report | Press Releases | Digital.ai](https://digital.ai/press-releases/17th-state-of-agile-report-71-use-agile-in-their-sdlc-small-organizations-report-strong-business-benefits-medium-and-larger-sized-companies-continue-to-experience-barriers-in-successfully-scaling-a/))
- Inadequate training and support from the company (source: [17th State of Agile Report | Press Releases | Digital.ai](https://digital.ai/press-releases/17th-state-of-agile-report-71-use-agile-in-their-sdlc-small-organizations-report-strong-business-benefits-medium-and-larger-sized-companies-continue-to-experience-barriers-in-successfully-scaling-a/))

## 5. The Disconnect: Agility in Vast, Distributed, and Complex Environments

<img src="/images/blog/agile-is-dead/remote.png" alt="remote work" />

The principles of agility, initially designed for small and co-located teams,
often encounter significant difficulties when it comes to applying them
at scale in large companies (source: [Limitations of Agile Methodologies - UMSL](https://www.umsl.edu/~sauterv/analysis/Fall2013Papers/Buric/limitations-of-agile-methodologies-1.html)).

Maintaining communication and collaboration becomes a major challenge when teams are large and geographically distributed. (source: [Challenges With Distributed Teams Working Agile - Newxel](https://newxel.com/blog/distributed-agile-team-challenges/))

Different time zones, cultural barriers, and the lack of face-to-face interactions can hinder the fluidity of exchanges and team cohesion.

Managing dependencies and ensuring alignment between numerous teams working on the same complex project
represents a significant challenge. Scaling frameworks like SAFe, although designed to address these
issues, are often criticized for their excessive bureaucracy and the loss of the agility they claim to promote (source: [Is Agile Dead? Examining the Decline in Market Demand and Popularity](https://www.programstrategyhq.com/post/is-agile-dead)).

They can introduce complexity that contradicts the initial agile spirit.
Furthermore, agility's emphasis on flexibility can prove problematic in highly regulated industries or for
projects subject to strict requirements and significant compliance imperatives. The ability to constantly modify
plans and requirements may be limited by regulatory constraints and contractual obligations.
Numerous cases of failed agile adoptions in large or complex projects have been documented (source: [What's behind the "268% higher failure rate" for Agile? - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/agile/comments/1dabpnt/whats_behind_the_268_higher_failure_rate_for_agile/)).

These examples highlight the difficulties organizations face when trying to apply a methodology initially conceived for simpler contexts to large-scale projects.

## 6. Beyond Agility? Exploring Alternative and Evolving Methodologies

<img src="/images/blog/agile-is-dead/hybrid-agile.png" alt="hybrid agile" />

Faced with the limitations of traditional agility, we are observing the emergence of so-called "post-agile" approaches that seek to retain
the fundamental values of agility while addressing the criticisms leveled against existing frameworks (source: [After Agile. - George Stocker](https://georgestocker.com/2024/01/18/after-agile/)).

Approaches like Management 3.0, which focuses on work culture and team autonomy (source: [What's after Agile? Methods in project management | Firmbee](https://firmbee.com/methods-in-project-management-2)),
or the Spotify model, which advocates for autonomous and multidisciplinary teams, attempt to overcome the rigidities of Scrum and SAFe.
Some even advocate for a return to the notion of "agility" as a verb, a capacity to adapt, rather than a noun designating a fixed methodology (source: [Agile at 20: The Failed Rebellion - Simple Thread](https://www.simplethread.com/agile-at-20-the-failed-rebellion/)).

There is also a growing integration of other methodologies and practices. Hybrid approaches,
combining elements of agility and the waterfall model, are gaining popularity, allowing organizations to benefit from the
flexibility of agility while retaining a certain structure and planning (source: [Agile Trends 2024: What Will Shape The Future Of Agile Project](https://www.spf-consulting.com/en/insights/agile-trends-project-management/)).
Lean and Kanban methods, focused on reducing waste and improving workflow, are also used as alternatives or in addition to
traditional agile approaches.

Finally, it is crucial to consider the impact of new technologies, particularly artificial intelligence,
on the evolution of software development methodologies.
AI could transform the way software is designed, developed, and tested, which
will require an adaptation of existing methodologies and the emergence of new approaches.

## Conclusion: A call to pragmatism in software development

My personal journey and the analysis of current trends lead me to the conclusion that agility, in its widely spread form today, is no longer the ideal it once represented at its beginning. The reasons for this conclusion are multiple, ranging from the observed deviations in the implementation of agile practices to the intrinsic limitations of this approach in vast and complex environments. The recurring criticisms concerning the lack of predictability, insufficient documentation, scope creep, excessive emphasis on processes at the expense of people, professional burnout, and the neglect of architecture reflect a deep unease within the community of developers and project managers. The decline in satisfaction with agility, despite its massive adoption, is a clear signal that something is no longer working as expected.

It is time to adopt a more pragmatic and contextual approach to software development. The emphasis should be placed on the fundamental principles of agility – the ability to adapt, collaboration, value delivery – rather than on rigid adherence to specific frameworks. The future of development methodologies probably lies in continuous evolution and adaptation to the specific needs of each project and each organization, potentially beyond the traditional definition of "Agile". The question that now arises is what will be the next step to continue to improve the way we design and develop quality software. AI and adaptive development methods could be the answer. To be continued...
